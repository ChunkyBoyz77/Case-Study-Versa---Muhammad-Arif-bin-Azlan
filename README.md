These are the steps to run the bigbangarif.py file:

1. Download the "bigbangarif.py" from the repository.
2. Open your chosen terminal.
3. Make sure the path to the file is correct.
4. Type the command "python bigbangarif.py" in the terminal.
5. The array generated will be printed on the terminal.
6. A json file containing the output will also be generated in your Downloads folder.
