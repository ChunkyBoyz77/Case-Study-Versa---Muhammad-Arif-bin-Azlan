# Case-Study-Versa---Muhammad-Arif-bin-Azlan
This is my python solution for the BigBang Case Study given for Versa's Developer Intern position.

These are the steps to run the bigbangarif.py file:

1. Open your chosen terminal.
2. Make sure the path to the file is correct.
3. Type the command "python bigbangarif.py" in the terminal.
4. The array generated will be printed on the terminal.
5. A json file containing the output will also be generated in your Downloads folder.
